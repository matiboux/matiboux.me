<p><b>Hi!</b> I'm Mati, a 21-years-old high school student and developer. I started my adventure in 2010 — approximately — by learning programming with the C language, and later with some Arduino and Processing, but now I mostly use web development languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript.</p>
<p>Since 2012, I have been working on various projects such as apps or websites. I'm an open-source enthusiast and some of my projects are available on my <a href="https://github.com/matiboux">Github account</a>. If you want to know a little more on me and my projects, please see my <a href="{{ '/cv' | relative_url }}">Curriculum-Vitae</a>, my <a href="{{ '/timeline' | relative_url }}">Work Timeline</a> or the showcase website for my projects: <a href="https://matiboux.com/">matiboux.com</a>.</p> <hr>

<p><b>Want to contact me?</b> Here's how:</p>
