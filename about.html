<p>
	My name is Mathieu GUÃ‰RIN.
	I'm {{ site.data.about.age }}-years-old and currently in my final year as an IT engineer student.
	I'm studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in a Master's degree  at <a href="https://www.epita.fr/">EPITA</a>.
	I'm also skilled as a back-end developer, leaning full-stack in web development.
</p>
<p>
	I first got into IT technologies in 2010, approximately, by learning programming with the C language.
	I wrote some basic console programs and tried to fiddle with the SDL library.
	Later on, I started to learn web development with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.
	Since 2012, I created many projects for my own account and a few more for others.
	I also explored and fiddled a bit with Arduino projects.
	As years passed, I kept learning about more tech tools and concepts, programming languages and paradigms, and machine learning.
</p>

<p>
	Today, I'm able to work with a variety of technologies and languages.
	I find myself comfortable working with web apps and much more. I have experience with many back-end languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C++.
	I'm also familiar with some front-end languages and frameworks for the web.
	Of course, I know how to work with databases and ORMs.
</p>

<p>
	I'm an open-source enthusiast and some of my projects are available on my <a href="https://github.com/matiboux">Github account</a>.
	Since 2018 after high school, I focus more on my studies and my work, but I still keep some time for my personal projects.
